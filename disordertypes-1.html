                        Overview: Anxiety disorders refer to the class of
                        mental disorders where people experience significant anxiety and fear. People
                        with anxiety disorders experience intense and long-lasting anxiety which
                        generally causes more than one type of anxiety disorder at a given time. It is
                        usually associated with depression. Research shows that anxiety disorders
                        impact approximately 40 million adults, nearly 20% of the general population,
                        in the U. S. with higher prevalence overall in women than men.

                        Overview: Generalized anxiety disorder is
                        characterized by chronic excessive worry about everyday life events. This worry
                        commonly results in clinically significant distress, disturbance in physical
                        functioning, and impairment in social life. It tends to occur along with mild
                        but persistent depression.

                            Causes: The causes of generalized anxiety disorder
                            have not been well understood, but it is primarily related to genetic factors
                            and environmental factors.

                            <b>Genetic Factors: </b>Genetic differences affect the balance of neurochemicals
                            in the brain. Some people may be born with low tolerance to future uncertainty
                            that could eventually result in irrational anxiety. Changes in the amygdala can
                            lead to high threat sensitivity and increase the tendency for people to
                            experience more frequent and more intense negative effects, which they could
                            react with avoidant coping.

                            parenting styles can make profound effects that may be long-lasting. For

                            involve low levels of warmth and supervision can result in people lacking
                            safety cues or with low levels of self-control.

                            Overview: Agoraphobia is an abnormal disorder where
                            people are afraid of staying in open spaces or being alone in such a space.
                            People with agoraphobia disorder generally feel unsafe in the open space and
                            present unpleasant physical symptoms such as shaking and vomiting. Research
                            shows that people with agoraphobia disorder is around 1.3% of the general
                            population and the disorder is overall more prevalent in women than in men.

                            (CBT). Through the way to modify cognition, challenging thought processes and
                            anxious schemas, people are exposed to the worry process, confront
                            fear-provoking images, and acquire anxiety-coping strategies in CBT.

                            Overview: Social phobia, also known as social anxiety
                            disorder, refers to an intense fear of being watched and humiliated by others
                            in public. People with social phobia try to avoid public exposure, because
                            otherwise they experience marked fear, anxiety, and distress when social
                            situations are inevitable. Social phobia typically develops in early
                            adolescence or early adulthood, but it sometimes can start in childhood.

                            learned from other people. Post-traumatic stress disorder not only results from
                            war experience, but many other traumatic events as well. Research shows that
                            PTSD actually affects 7-8% of the general population, usually among people with
                            13 years or older.

                            Stress Disorder. Antidepressants especially SSRI help relieve the symptoms of depression and release
                            anxieties which are the most common type of medication used in PTSD. The use of
                            antidepressants help to concentrate attention and raise awareness of the body
                            which contribute to changes in attitudes and behaviors.

                            encourages patients to talk to psychiatrists and other mental health providers.
                            The major type of therapy used in PTSD is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT).
                            It helps to modify thought patterns, challenge thought processes and anxious
                            schemas. People generally experience exposure to worry process, confront
                            anxiety-provoking images, and acquire anxiety-coping strategies in CBT.
